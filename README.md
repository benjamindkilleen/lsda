# Benjamin Killeen's Supplementary Material for CMSC 25025

Machine learning is awesome! Unfortunately, some parts can be frustrating. Here,
I do my best to alleviate that frustration with some short, hopefully useful
guides, intended for the students of CMSC 25025: Machine Learning and
Large-scale Data Analysis at the University of Chicago.

1. The "Earth to Jupyter in 30 Seconds: Getting Started on Midway" guide can be
   found [here](https://github.com/bendkill/lsda/blob/master/docs/rcc_guide.md).
